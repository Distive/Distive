# Deployment & Managment

## Deploying Distive
Deploying a Distive Server is very simple, requires no external authentication and takes less than a minute.

Simply go to the [Distive Dashboard](https://dashboard.distive.com): 
`New Profile > New Canister`

Note down the `Canister ID` for later use during integration.

## Adding Cycles
Cycles are needed to run a Distive Server. When you deploy a new Distive Server, it is allocated 100_000_000_000 free cycles. You can add cycles to your canister by clicking `Add Cycles`, this would direct you to the Canister Tip Jar page.

You can use a temporary account, follow the steps on the page.
