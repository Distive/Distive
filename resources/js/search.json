Public services like Distive on the IC unlike traditional software have alot less moving parts; there are no ports, databases, external caching services, firewalls, etc. This makes Distive very simple and trivial to deploy.","Distive's pricing model works like this: services (canisters in Internet Computer terms) are given free credits (cycles) to run each month. When a service runs out of cycles, it freezes and can't be queried. You can then add more cycles to it. A small percentage of these cycles (currently 5%) are taxed and distributed to other services to keep running for free.","Every Distive service (canister) deployed is standalone and can only be controlled by its owner. It is not a single database with multiple users stored in it. This means nobody, including me, can control what happens to your deployed service (canister).","Distive is written in Rust, and the source code is available on Github."]},{"i":"how-can-i-use-distive-","l":"How can I use Distive ?","p":["Head over to the Dashboard and create a new service(canister)","Then use the Canister ID to integrate or build your own software following the Integration Guide"]}],[{"l":"Integrations"},{"i":"sdk-or-react-library-","l":"SDK or React Library ?","p":["Use the SDK if you want server side rendering.","Use the SDK if you want to integrate Distive in a with a different Front-end library like Angular or VueJS","Use the React Library if you want an easy to use interface for your client-side ReactJS project."]}],[{"i":"distivereact","l":"@distive/react","p":["npm"]},{"l":"Getting set up","p":["To use Distive, go to the Distive Dashboard, create a new service(canister), and copy your Canister ID."]},{"i":"installing-distivereact","l":"Installing @distive/react","p":["If you're planning to add authentication, you'll need to install:","The package exports a initDistiveHook function that initializes the Distive Hook."]},{"l":"Using useDistive hook","p":["useDistive returns an object with the following properties:"]},{"l":"DistiveHook Properties","p":["() = void","(input: AddPostInput) = void","(input: ToggleMetadataInput) = void","(input: UpdatePostInput) = void","(postID: string) = void","Add a post","addPost","boolean","Call this function to load more data.","Contains object of all posts keyed by their ID.
